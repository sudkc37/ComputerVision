Abstracts:

Computer vision has revolutionized the way we interpret images through deep learning techniques. This paper explores the performance of various Convolution models, including fine-tuned VGG16, VGG19 and ResNet50, a base mathematical model, a deep CNN model, and a retrained ResNet50 model. Cosine similarity is utilized to identify similar image vectors. The primary objective is to compare the architectures of these models and evaluate their benchmarking performance.  Additionally, an image retrieval system is developed, allowing users to upload an image and receive visually similar images from a database.


Introduction:

Before delving into the technical aspects of an Image Retrieval System, let’s start with a high-level overview. Imagine you admire a colleague's outfit but feel hesitant to ask about its name. Fortunately, you have a group photo where they are wearing it. You decide to search for the outfit on your favorite online shopping platform, but you have no details about the dress. You wish the platform had a feature that allows you to upload an image and return similar items from their inventory. This is exactly what an Image Retrieval System does—it takes an image as input and finds visually similar images from its database.

But how does it work? Let's now explore the inner workings of the Image Retrieval System in more detail. Section I covers the fundamental concepts of computer vision and the architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  Section II discusses the base model and the custom convolutional model. Section 3 focuses on the fine-tuned models, their architectures, and benchmarking their performance. Section 4 utilizes the most robust models, retraining them with specific images for improved accuracy. Section 5 explains the frontend design and the APIs used for interaction. The final section presents the conclusion, highlights the limitations, and outlines areas for improvement to enhance feature extraction.


Computer Vision and Convolution Neural Network Architecture
Computer vision enables machines to analyze and interpret visual data from images or video frames by identifying patterns and extracting meaningful insights. It uses advanced techniques such as object detection, classification, and segmentation to recognize, categorize, and make decisions based on visual information. These models are trained on large datasets and employ mathematical algorithms to detect and label objects within an image. For example, a computer vision model could analyze an image down to the pixel level to identify if the object depicted is a pair of shorts, based on learned patterns. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) plays a crucial role in this process by mapping pixels and embedding images into feature vectors. Before diving into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), let’s briefly explore the architecture of a deep (or dense) neural network. In a deep neural network, each neuron is connected to every neuron in the neighboring layers. To illustrate, here is a simple example:

Similarly, CNNs also utilize deep architectures, but they extract features from images using convolution operations. A simple CNN architecture typically consists of feature extraction layers, which include convolution and pooling layers. The extracted feature vectors are then fed into fully connected layers of the deep neural network for classification or other tasks.
